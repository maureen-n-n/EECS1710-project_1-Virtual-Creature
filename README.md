# EECS1710-project_1-Virtual-Creature
This project allows users to take care of a virtual pet chicken! Follow the directions on the lower half of the screen to see your hatch into a baby chick and grow up into a chicken who can lay its own eggs!

The project is split into 3 different files: virtualCreature.pde, creatureStates.pde and progressBars.pde. Each of these files contain functions which work together to create this interactive virtual creature game. The program also requires the attached data folder to be downloaded which includes illustrations of the virtual pet that will be used throughout the program.

To run the program, you must:
  1. Download all .pde file in this repo and save them into one folder
  2. Download the data folder and save it in the same folder as step 1.
  3. Open any .pde file in processing.
  4. Press run and enjoy! This program does not require downloading any external libraries.

Essentially, when the user first runs the program, the creature is still an egg. The user will be prompted to click anywhere on the screen to hatch this egg; when clicking on the screen a green bar appears on the top which represents the hatching progress. If the user stops clicking on the screen, the bar will slowly decrease, so keep clicking!

When the egg is done hatching, the creature will turn into a chick which now has two bars: a sleep progress bar and a food progress bar. The user will be prompted to left click their mouse to increase the food progress, and in turn the image of the creature will switch to the respective sprite. The same goes with right clicking to increase the sleep progress bar.

Once the chick is fully fed and rested, the creature will become a chicken which has the same functions as the chick, but instead will be able to lay eggs when fully rested and fed. Users will be prompted to press the spacebar when this happens to increase a counter that is seen towards the bottom of the screen. Once an egg is layed, the progress bars reset andusers can keep repeating this process.

Enjoy!
